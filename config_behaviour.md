# Configuration Behavior Analysis

## Overview
The configuration settings control how output is displayed from an LLM, particularly focusing on the presentation of thought processes and how multiple outputs are aggregated.

## Settings Explained

### `separator`
- **Purpose**: Defines the string used to separate different outputs when they are concatenated
- **Format**: In all examples, it's set to `"\n\nSEPARATOR\n\n"` (the word "SEPARATOR" with double newlines before and after)
- **Behavior**: Only appears in the output when `skip_final_aggregation` is set to `false`

**Example**:
```
# With separator (skip_final_aggregation: false)
I'm an AI assistant.

SEPARATOR

# Without separator (skip_final_aggregation: true)
I'm an AI assistant.

```

### `hide_intermediate_think`
- **Purpose**: Controls visibility of thinking sections marked with specific tags
- **Values**: 
  - `false`: Shows the thinking tags and their content in output
  - `true`: Hides all content within the thinking tags

**Example**:
```
# With intermediate thinking visible (hide_intermediate_think: false)
Hi there!
I'm an AI assistant.

# With intermediate thinking hidden (hide_intermediate_think: true)
Hi there!
I'm an AI assistant.
```

### `hide_final_think`
- **Purpose**: Controls visibility of final thinking sections
- **Values**:
  - `false`: Shows final thinking sections in output
  - `true`: Hides final thinking sections

**Example**:
```
# With final thinking visible (hide_final_think: false)
Hi there! I'm an AI assistant.

# With final thinking hidden (hide_final_think: true)
Hi there! I'm an AI assistant.
```

### `thinking_tags`
- **Purpose**: Defines which tags are identified as thinking sections
- **Value**: In all examples set to `["think", "reason", "reasoning", "thought", "Thought"]`
- **Behavior**: These tags identify sections that will be affected by the `hide_intermediate_think` and `hide_final_think` settings

**Example**:
```
# The following tags will be treated as thinking sections:

<reason>This is reasoning content</reason>
<thought>This is a thought</thought>
```

### `skip_final_aggregation`
- **Purpose**: Controls whether outputs are combined with separators
- **Values**:
  - `false`: Outputs are concatenated with the defined separator between them
  - `true`: Outputs appear without the separator

**Example**:
```
# With final aggregation (skip_final_aggregation: false)
Response 1

SEPARATOR

Response 2

# Without final aggregation (skip_final_aggregation: true)
Response 1
Response 2
```

## Interactions Between Settings

### Separator and Skip Final Aggregation
- The `separator` only has an effect when `skip_final_aggregation` is `false`

**Example**:
```
# Configuration:
# separator: "\n\nSEPARATOR\n\n"
# skip_final_aggregation: false

Hello! I'm an AI.

SEPARATOR

How can I help you?

# Same outputs with skip_final_aggregation: true
Hello! I'm an AI.
How can I help you?
```

### Hiding Thinking Sections - Combined Effects

**Example with multiple settings**:
```
# Configuration:
# hide_intermediate_think: true
# hide_final_think: false
# skip_final_aggregation: false

Hello!
I'm an AI assistant.

SEPARATOR

How can I help you today?

# Configuration:
# hide_intermediate_think: true
# hide_final_think: true
# skip_final_aggregation: true

Hello!
I'm an AI assistant.
How can I help you today?
```

## Configuration Patterns and Effects

| hide_intermediate_think | hide_final_think | skip_final_aggregation | Result |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------------|--------|
| false | false | false | Shows all thinking tags and content; outputs separated by defined separator |
| true | false | false | Hides intermediate thinking tags; shows final thinking; outputs separated by defined separator |
| false | true | false | Shows intermediate thinking tags; hides final thinking; outputs separated by defined separator |
| false | false | true | Shows all thinking tags and content; no separators between outputs |
| true | true | false | Hides all thinking (intermediate and final); outputs separated by defined separator |
| false | true | true | Shows intermediate thinking tags; hides final thinking; no separators between outputs |
| true | false | true | Hides intermediate thinking tags; shows final thinking; no separators between outputs |
| true | true | true | Hides all thinking (intermediate and final); no separators between outputs |

## Practical Example

**Raw LLM output with multiple sections**:
```


Hello! I'm an AI assistant.

I can answer questions, provide information, or assist with various tasks.
```

**Output with hide_intermediate_think: false, hide_final_think: false, skip_final_aggregation: false**:
```


Hello! I'm an AI assistant.

SEPARATOR

SEPARATOR

```

**Output with hide_intermediate_think: true, hide_final_think: true, skip_final_aggregation: true**:
```

```

## Summary
These configuration settings provide fine-grained control over:
1. How thinking processes are displayed (both intermediate and final)
2. Whether multiple outputs are aggregated with separators
3. What specific tags identify thinking sections

This allows for customizing the appearance of LLM outputs based on different use cases, whether focusing on the final polished response or showing the reasoning process.
